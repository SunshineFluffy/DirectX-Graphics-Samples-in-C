## DirectX-Graphics-Samples-in-C
This repo contains a port of the [offical DirectX 12 Graphics samples](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples) to C.

This is a working in progress project that I created for educational purposes, in order to learn better about COM and DirectX.
Also check the companion for this project, [DirectX-Headers-in-C](https://github.com/simstim-star/DirectX-Headers-in-C)
